# Data Structures #

Every box in `boxes` is an independent project, but some code is shared. This is
an automated dependancy and build system. There is an interface to which we
adhere: projects are subdirectories of `boxes`, have `test` and `src`, `make` creates
a test in `bin`, and `traits` are the same for every project.

These are (some) implementers:

* [array](https://github.com/neil-edelman/array);
* [heap](https://github.com/neil-edelman/heap);
* [list](https://github.com/neil-edelman/list);
* [orcish](https://github.com/neil-edelman/orcish);
* [pool](https://github.com/neil-edelman/pool);
* [set](https://github.com/neil-edelman/set);
* [trie](https://github.com/neil-edelman/trie)
